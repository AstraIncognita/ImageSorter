# ImageSorter
It is a program which helps to sort large amounts of images.
It is written in Java using JavaFX, so it should be theoretically cross-platform, although it was only tested in Windows.

# Installation
ImageSorter can be downloaded at the Releases tab. There are two versions: cross-platform one, which requires JavaFX runtime components, and a standalone fat Jar, which is built using a workaround and is expected to work only in Windows.

# Usage
Waiting state of a program. You can select one input directory, from which images will be moved, and multiple output directories, in which images will be moved. After pressing Start Button sorting will begin.

Sorting state of a program. After seeing a picture, user can decide in which directory to move it. At the bottom, user can change the name of the image or skip image entirely. In this case it will remain in input directory. Also, user can stop sorting to reconfigure directories.
